# Unity Game Easy Decensor Package

## Description
Just a little package of plugins for BepInEx for decensoring unity games (removing the mosaic filter usually found in Japanese games)

I created this package to make it easy for me to uncensor Unity-made games

### Main Instruction

1. Simply extract the files from the ZIP file into the `root folder` of the Unity game directory (the folder where the .exe file is)

2. After extracting or copying the files and folder over to the game directory, 
simply open up your Unity game and you will be greeted by Menus from the UnityExplorer plugin on the game's Main Menu

### Alternate Instruction

1. Simply download, copy and paste all other files ***except for the .txt*** files into the game's `root directory` (in the same folder as the .exe file of the unity game)
or copy all of them if you cant be bothered, it will still work.

2. After extracting or copying the files and folder over to the `root game directory`, 
simply open up your Unity game and you will be greeted by Menus from the UnityExplorer plugin on the game's Main Menu
