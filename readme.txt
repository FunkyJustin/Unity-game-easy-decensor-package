the bepinex version in this package is this

BepInEx_win_x64_5.4.23.2

simply copy all other files except for the .txt files into the game root directory, in other words, in the same folder as the .exe file of the unity game, 
or copy all of them if you cant be bothered, it will stll work.



i created this package to make it easy for me to uncensor unity-made games
